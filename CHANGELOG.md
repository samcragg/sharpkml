  getters and setters
- Parsing of coordinate collections now stops further processing if the correct
  tuple separator (whitespace) is not present
### Fixed

## [3.4.0] - 2018-08-09
### Added
- `KmlFactory` can now register additional valid child types
### Changed

## [3.3.0] - 2018-07-29
### Added

### Changed
- All classes representing KML elements are no longer marked as `sealed`

## [3.2.0] - 2018-07-14
### Changed
- Reduced memory usage for large files with lots of elements (thanks @sylvaneau)

## [3.1.0] - 2018-04-29
### Added
- Arithmetic operators for the Vector class (thanks @MikDal002)

## [3.0.5] - 2018-04-18
### Fixed
- Fix for https://github.com/samcragg/sharpkml/issues/8
  - When serializing, prefixes are not used if the namespace of the element
    matches the default namespace in scope.

## [3.0.4] - 2018-03-08
### Added
- Support for .NET 4.5

## [3.0.3] - 2018-02-27
### Fixed
- Fix for https://github.com/samcragg/sharpkml/issues/5
  - SimpleArrayData was trying to return the inner text of the created elements,
    however, it hadn't copied it across from the UnknownElement. This has been
    fixed so now the nested values can be retrieved.
  - SimpleArrayData didn't have any values if namespaces were being ignored
    during parsing - this has now been fixed.

## [3.0.2] - 2018-02-04
### Fixed
- Fix for https://github.com/samcragg/sharpkml/issues/4
  - For improved compatibility with Google Earth, `innerBoundaryIs` with
    multiple `LinearRing` elements (which is invalid) is now handled without
    loss of information.
  - Made `Element.AddChild` virtual
  - Modified `InnerBoundary` to check if it already has a `LinearRing` set - if
    it does then it will try to add a new `InnerBoundary` to its parent

## [3.0.1] - 2017-11-04
### Changed
- Updated package to target .NET Standard 1.2
- Changed license from MS-PL to MIT
